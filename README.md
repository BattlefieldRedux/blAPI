# blAPI
Battlelog API - simple, one-class API to get data from Battlelog. 

It not only downloads data, but also returns it in ready to use way - class can replace all of these pesky numbers with real values. For example, Battlelog returns name *MP_Tremors*. That won't tell you much, will it? Just pass **true** at the end of arguments, and blAPI will change this garbage into *Dawnbreaker*. It's nifty, isn't it? :)

Futher information to come.
